# Merlin's TaskPaper Intro

- Step Zero
    // TODO Why I like and often recommend TaskPaper
    - who this probably is and isn't for
- First Steps
    - get the Mac app // TODO link to Mac app
    - read about getting started // TODO link to Getting Started
    - pick a way to sync between devices
- Learn these key commands[^1] <!-- TODO look up O'Reilly conventions for formatting commands -->
    - "Tag with…Done" - **`CMD-D`**
    - "Archive @done items" - **`CMD-SHIFT-A`**
    - "Move to Project…" - **`CMD-/`**
    - "Tag with…" - **`CMD-T`**
- Best Practices
    - keep it clean, keep it simple
    - limitations are _good_
        - this is a pocket, not an attic
            - (and most definitely _not_ a storage shed)
    - consider giving your tags names starting with alphabetically unique letters
        - allows way faster, no-look autocomplete
    - // TODO put more Best Practices here
- Becoming a power user
    - learn examples of handy Sidebar and Editor searches
    - add your most used tags and searches as defaults in the "Configurations" folder
    - use parenthesis to make sub-tags
        - e.g. `@errands(Apple Store)` will then nest underneath  `@errands`
    - for occasional enhanced focus, use multiple windows
    - learn folding to collapse or expand items
        - acquaint yourself with the contents under and commands of the "Outline" menu
- Later nice-to-haves
    - adapt a `.less` style sheet to your tastes and to visually highlight your most important tags
        - RECC: start with an existing style sheet
            - to learn how it works
            - to save yourself a huge amount of effort
  - // TODO put more sexy, later-on stuff here

[^1]: I'm _pretty_ sure these are the default key commands. But, if you ever have any doubt (as ever) just type `CMD-SHIFT-/` to bring up the Help menu to search all the menu items.
