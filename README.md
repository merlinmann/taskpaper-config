Merlin's TaskPaper Configuration Files plus a Sample Document

## What This Is

These are some of my significant TaskPaper files. They might be useful in helping you get started with being a TaskPaper power user with a minimum of fussing and fiddling.

###  ðŸ“” Sample Document

**`sample.taskpaper`** is a makebelieve, redacted version of a typical TaskPaper document as I would use it.

### ðŸ“‚ Config Files

One is a Style Sheet, while the others provide "Set It and Forget It" defaults that I like to have available in every TaskPaper document. Any and all can be edited to suit your needs.

* **`searches.taskpaper`** is the equivalent of "Saved Searches" or, if you like "Smart Tasklists." Not dissimilar to a _very_ simple version of what OmniFocus calls a _perspective_.
* **`tags.taskpaper`** ensures that all my favorite "tags" (think: <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> contexts) should be available and autofillable in all my TaskPaper documents.

## To Install Config Files

1. **PLEASE** proceed carefully, know what you're doing, and please make backups before you do or change anything
1. The files in this `TaskPaper` folder go hierarchically in:  
    `/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/TaskPaper/`
3. Thusly:
   * `/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/TaskPaper/Configurations/searches.taskpaper`
   * `/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/TaskPaper/Configurations/tags.taskpaper`
