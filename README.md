Merlin's TaskPaper Configuration Files

## What It Is

These are some of my significant TaskPaper files. One is a Style Sheet, while the others provide "Set It and Forget It" defaults I like to have available in any TaskPaper document.

* **`searches.taskpaper`** is the equivalent of "Saved Searches" or, if you like "Smart Tasklists." Not dissimilar to a _very_ simple version of what OmniFocus calls a _perspective_.
* **`tags.taskpaper`** ensures that all my favorite "tags" (think: <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> contexts) should be available and autofillable in all my TaskPaper documents.

## To Install It

1. **PLEASE** proceed carefully, know what you're doing, and please make backups before you do or change anything
1. The files in this `TaskPaper` folder go hierarchically in:  
    `/Users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/TaskPaper/`
